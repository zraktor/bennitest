From an Admin Tool perspective, we untick staff who are on reduced pay (i.e. statutory pay) as it’s very minimal and throughout their time of unpaid leave.

"Why does cost classification matter?,""Cost classification is important since using the wrong budget or cost classification to account for your planned / delivered activities leaves the Department open to the National Audit Office (NAO) and HMT criticism.

Depending on the value and nature of the reclassification the case may need to go to the Cost Classification Panel for sign off."",,,,",
"When should capital funding (CDEL) be used?,""The CDEL budget generally covers ‘Financial Transactions’ for loans given and ‘General Capital’ for spending on all other assets or investments. ",
"Capital grants are scored as Capital for budgets where the receiving body is investing those funds in a capital asset. Capital budget is triggered by capital spend in the Department where spend meets the appropriate accounting standard recognition criteria (this could either be IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment or IAS 38 Intangible Assets).  In rare cases, the research phase (normally expensed and treated as admin for budgets) can be treated as capital for budgets but this is rare, but expensed in accounting terms. The spend is subject to 5 criteria which are often difficult to satisfy. For further information, please contact the Cost Classification team."",,,,",
"Can I capitalise staff costs?,""The capitalisation of staff costs is possible (under IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment or IAS 38 Intangible Assets), subject to whether these costs are directly linked to the creation of an asset.  It is often difficult to justify the capitalisation of very senior or junior members of staff as these roles would most likely not be direct enough. Specialist individuals (e.g. technical architects) are easier to justify for capitalisation. For intangible assets especially this can be complex, if in doubt please contact the cost classification team.  In order to register an intangible asset, please email financialaccounting.capital@education.gov.uk."",,,,",
"What is an intangible asset and when can one be recognised?,""Intangible assets are non-monetary assets that are without physical substance and identifiable (either being separable or arising from contractual or other legal rights).

"I am currently writing a business case and want to check the cost classification, what do I do?,Please contact the Cost Classification team who will be happy to help you with your business case.,,,,",

"How do I treat costs associated with development of an intangible asset in reference to the Agile methodology?,""The Agile Methodology has been cross referenced to the accounting standard for intangible assets. The budgeting follows the accounting treatment. The Discovery and Alpha stages are akin to the 'Research' phase of IAS 38 Intangible Assets, where associated costs are expensed and come from admin budgets. The Beta phase is equivalent to the 'Development' phase and is suitable for capitalisation. Please note, there should be robust audit evidence documenting the transition to the Beta phase, should the costs be subject to audit scrutiny in the future. The costs from the 'Live' stage onwards depend on the purpose of the asset. They could be admin or programme funded. If in doubt please contact the cost classification team.
